# How to build “candle” charts of stock exchange assets.

Goal:
This experiment demonstrates how to build "candle" charts of assets.
For this, two finance libraries in phyton were used, tested in the "Jupyter-Notebook" environment, but if you prefer, you can replicate them in Colab.

## Get Started
1. First, at the terminal, you must clone the project (here we use the HTTP protocol, but if you prefer you can copy the project's SSH protocol link):

2. Second, you must install the following libraries in your python environment:

#### Libraries used:
* yfinance
* mplfinance

3. Third, in this step after installing the library, open your development tool in python and import the libraries:

```
import mplfinance as fplt;
import yfinance as yf;
```
4. Fourth, here we import a paper history, for example MGLU3:

```
import mplfinance as fplt;
import yfinance as yf;
```
In addition we can look at the data..

5. Fifth, the generated data can be plotted using the mplfinance library.

```
import mplfinance as fplt;
import yfinance as yf;
```
You can check the result in the phi file provided.
I hope you enjoyed!
